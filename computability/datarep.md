# Bijections

* A function $f : A \to B$ is __injective__ (or 1-1) just if for any $a_1, a_2
\in A$ we have that $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ implies $a_1 = a_2$.

* A function $f : A \to B$ is __surjective__ just if for any $b \in B$ there
exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.

* A function $f : A \to B$ is a __bijection__ just if it is injective and
surjective.
# Inverses

Let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

$f$ has an __inverse__ just if there exists a function $f^{-1} : B \to A$ such that
* $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$
* $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$

Both equations are necessary. Using [function
composition](https://uob-coms20007.github.io/reference/prereqs/functions.html#composition)
and the [identity
function](https://uob-coms20007.github.io/reference/prereqs/functions.html#identity-function),
they may be re-written in a so-called _point-free_ style as
* $f^{-1} \circ f = \textsf{id}_A$
* $f \circ f^{-1} = \textsf{id}_B$

In the problem sheet you will prove the following result.

*Claim.* A function $f : A \to B$ is a bijection if and only if it has an inverse.

Thus, a bijection $f : A \to B$ is a device for putting the sets $A$ and $B$
into perfect correspondence: it maps every $a \in A$ to a uniquely associated
$b \in B$. 
# Integers vs. natural numbers

In light of this, the following result is a bit surprising.

Define

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\beta : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N} \\
  &\beta(x) = \begin{cases}
    2x    & \text{ if $x \geq 0$} \\
    -2x-1 & \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\beta$ maps 
* positive numbers to even numbers
* negative numbers to odd numbers

*Claim.* The function $\beta$ is a bijection.

_Proof._ 

1. $\beta$ is injective. Let $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$, and suppose $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$.
   There are four cases to consider:
   * *$k_1, k_2$ both positive.* Then $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$ is exactly the statement that $2k_1 = 2k_2$, whence $k_1 = k_2$.
   * *$k_1, k_2$ both negative.* Then $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$ is exactly the statement that $-2k_1 - 1 = -2k_2 - 1$, whence $k_1 = k_2$.
   * *$k_1$ positive, $k_2$ negative.* Then $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$ is exactly the statement that $2k_1 = -2k_2 - 1$. From this we infer $k_1 + k_2 = -1/2$, which cannot happen as both are whole numbers. Thus, this case cannot occur in practice, so there is nothing to prove.
   * *$k_1$ negative, $k_2$ positive.* Similar to the last case.

2. $\beta$ is surjective. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We consider the parity of $n$.
   * If $n$ is even, write it as $n = 2n'$. Then $f(n') = 2n' = n$.
   * If $n$ is odd, write it as $n = 2n' + 1$. Then $f(-n' - 1) = -2(-n' - 1) - 1 = 2n' + 1$.

Hence $\beta$ is a bijection. â–£

By the _Claim_ about bijections shown above, the function $\beta$ has an inverse. It is explicitly given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \beta^{-1} : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}
  & \beta^{-1}(n) = \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \text{ if $n$ is even} \\
    - (n+1)/2 & \text{ if $n$ is odd}
  \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Within `while` we can compute $\beta$ (wrt `x`) by the code
```
  if (x >= 0) then x := 2 * x else x := (-2 * x) - 1
```

Moreover, we can compute $\beta^{-1}$ (wrt `x`) by the code
```
  r := x; q := 0;
  while (2 <= r) { q := q + 1; r := r - 2 };
  if r = 0 then x := q else x := - (q + 1)
```

# Sections and retractions

A function $s : A \to B$ is a __section__ just when there exists a
corresponding __retraction__, i.e. a function $r : B \to A$ such that for all
$a \in A$ it is the case that $r(s(a)) = a$.

In point-free style, this is written as $r \circ s = \textsf{id}_A$.

A retraction is _not_ an inverse to the section. Rather, it is a 'one-sided
inverse.' In terms of data representation, it says that we can encode every
$a \in A$ as $s(a) \in B$. We can then 'recover' the original $a$ by
computing the element $r(s(a)) = a$.
