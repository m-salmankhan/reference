# Abstract Syntax

The abstract syntax of a programming language is a structured representation of programs in the language, which normally simplifies aspects of the concrete syntax. It gives rise to abstract syntax trees, which are operated on by interpreters and compilers.

The type of abstract syntax trees we'll consider for the While language is in file [while/src/WhileAST.hs](https://github.com/uob-coms20007/labcode/blob/main/while/src/WhileAST.hs) of the labcode.
